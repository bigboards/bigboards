## Installation
### Prerequisites
#### Network
The nodes of your cluster should have a valid network configuration. This means all nodes are able to contact each other and the nodes are resolvable through DNS. 

#### Date/Time
The system clock of all the nodes should also be in sync. The easiest way to accomplish this is through the use of the NTP daemon.

#### NodeJS

#### Ansible

#### Consul

#### Docker
